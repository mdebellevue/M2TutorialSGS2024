Macaulay2 runs natively on Mac or Linux.  It can be installed on windows by first installing "windows subsystem for linux" which provides a small virtual linux computer within your windows computer.

Macaulay2 can be run independently, but is most user-friendly when running within "emacs" which is a text editing program.
Ensure that emacs is installed on your system using your package manager (analogously to how you installed Macaulay2).

With M2, enter "setup()".  This configures emacs to work with Macaulay2.

Workflow for M2 in emacs is to run a M2 window by hitting f12, then edit a file and send the lines to the M2 window by moving your cursor to the line and hitting f11.

There are also differences between running it in-terminal versus with a graphical user interface.  The graphical user interface has some expected functionality (click to move your cursor, buttons for opening and saving files, etc.)

Emacs has its own vast array of keyboard shortcuts.
These are specified by C-(some key - usually a letter)) for pressing and holding the control key followed by the specified key, or by M-(some key) for holding the "meta key" - alt on windows keyboards, option on mac - followed by the specified key.
The following "cheat sheet" provides a list of most-used shortcuts: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf 

Some useful shortcuts:
Previous/Next command entered into Macaulay2: M-p or M-n
Halt a Macaulay2 computation: C-c C-c
Back out of an emacs command in process (useful if you get stuck): C-x C-g

Open a file (creating it if it doesn't exist): C-x C-f (then type the file name)
Save a file: C-x C-s
Close a file: C-x k

Switch windows: C-x o
"scroll" a frame between open files: C-x (left arrow/right arrow) 

Copy/Paste:
    Select text: Set mark with C-SPC (control-space). Move to end of region
    Cut/Copy text: C-w for cut (copy and delete old text), M-w for copy
    Paste: C-y

Hw: 
Install Macaulay2 and emacs on your system and configure them to work together.

Open emacs, start M2 within it, open a file, write the line "2+2", and send it to M2 for evaluation.  Save the file.
